📌 Problem Statement
Wine quality is often judged through costly and subjective human evaluation. This project builds a Random Forest model to predict wine quality using chemical features like acidity, alcohol, sugar, and pH — enabling fast, reliable, and automated assessments.

🧪 Features Used
Fixed Acidity

Volatile Acidity

Citric Acid

Residual Sugar

Free Sulfur Dioxide

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

...and more
